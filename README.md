Hey! Welcome to my Github page. My name is Hsuan-Hau, but I go by the name Howard. I'm a software engineer at Google working on full-stack web development. I'm interested in a lot of areas and always experimenting with different tools and technologies. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing sports, instruments, photography, video editing, etc.

Hope you find something useful here!
